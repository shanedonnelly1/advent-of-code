# Advent of code

Repo for my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

## Setup new day

* Copy template folder to new folder in advent-of-code (using day-04 as example)

    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/developments/repos/react-tests/advent-of-code
    cp -R day-xx day-04
    ```

* Change all references to day-xx in new directory to the current day.

* Run the index file

    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/developments/repos/react-tests/advent-of-code
    npx ts-node day-xx/index.01
    ```

* Run the tests

    ```bash
    npx jest
    ```
